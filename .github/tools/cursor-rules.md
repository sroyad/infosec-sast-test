# Cursor Rule: CodeQL triage policy
- Always reason from the inlined files; do not guess.
- Prefer "UNCERTAIN" if there is not enough proof to conclude TP or FP.
- Return EXACTLY one JSON object with:
  - classification: "TP" | "FP" | "UNCERTAIN"
  - certainty: 0–100
  - rationale: ≤ 800 chars; reference exact files/lines
  - evidence: array of { path, lines?, reason }
  - reproduce_steps: steps or null
  - fix_suggestion: concise fix
- Treat sanitizer patterns (validation, encoding, parameterized queries, strict allowlists) as FP if they fully cover the dataflow.
- If you claim TP, cite the exact source → transformations → sink with files and line ranges.
- If you claim FP, cite the guard/sanitizer/dead-code reasoning with files and line ranges.
